Hey! I'm Loc Son, a front-end developer passionate about building clean, modern, and user-friendly web applications.

Specialized in {Next.js} {Tailwind CSS} {Shadcn UI} <br />
2+ years of experience crafting responsive and accessible interfaces <br />
Enjoy working with {React} {TypeScript}

I love turning ideas into interactive experiences and improving workflows with modern tools. My focus is on creating pixel-perfect designs and smooth user experiences. You can check out my [projects here](/projects).

I also write [blog posts](/posts) and share insights about front-end development, UI libraries, and building side projects. Occasionally, I experiment with design systems and component libraries.

Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new design trends, reading about product building, and playing around with creative coding. I’m always looking for ways to grow as a developer and collaborate on exciting projects.

If you're around, feel free to reach out—let’s connect or even build something cool together.
