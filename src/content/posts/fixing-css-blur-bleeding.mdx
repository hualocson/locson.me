It’s always bothered me that `filter: blur()` lets light bleed past the edges. I started experimenting to see if there was a cleaner way to blur without that glow. Here’s what I found.

---

## The Problem

When you apply a blur in CSS like this:

```css
.element {
  filter: blur(10px);
}
```

You’ll notice that the edges glow or bleed — the blurred pixels extend beyond the element’s box.
That’s fine for photos, but not ideal for UI elements where you want clean borders or rounded corners.

Example: a frosted glass card that suddenly looks like it’s glowing around the edges.

## Experiment 1 — Regular CSS Blur

Using `filter: blur()` directly is the simplest approach, but it doesn’t respect the element’s boundaries.

Result: Smooth blur, but unwanted light bleeding.

## Experiment 2 — Backdrop Filter via Pseudo-element

What if we blur the background behind the element instead?

```css
.card::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border-radius: inherit;
}
```

This creates a frosted-glass effect that feels more natural, since it blurs the background rather than the element itself.

> Problem: In Chrome and Safari, backdrop-filter can break the border-radius or behave inconsistently during transitions.

## Experiment 3 — SVG Filter (More Control)

SVG filters give you fine-grained control over how blur works.
Here’s an example using feGaussianBlur with feComponentTransfer:

Then apply it in CSS:

```css
.element {
  filter: url(#blur);
}
```

**Pros:**

- Better edge control.
- Avoids the excessive light bleed.

**Cons:**

- Can introduce banding artifacts — visible “steps” in the gradient instead of a smooth blur.

## Animating Blur

I’m predicting blur will become a common animation trend for entrance and exit transitions — think smooth fade-ins with soft motion blur.

**SVG Animation (Smooth)**

SVG supports animations directly with SMIL:

```tsx
<animate attributeName="stdDeviation" from="0" to="10" dur="0.3s" />
```

It runs smoothly and gives a cinematic feel.

**CSS Backdrop Animation (Buggy)**

Chrome still has issues animating backdrop-filter, resulting in janky or incomplete transitions.
It might work better in Safari, but it’s not reliable across browsers yet.

## Takeaway

- `filter: blur()` is easy but bleeds light.
- `backdrop-filter` looks good for glass effects but has browser quirks.

- SVG filters offer full control — great for precise design or animation, though not perfect.

For now, SVG filters are the most consistent way to achieve a clean, controlled blur without glowing edges — especially if you plan to animate it.
